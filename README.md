# Pre-Doctoral Researcher Application Sample
## Author: Ryan Wang
This repository contains my writing and coding samples. The writing sample, titled "Writing Sample," is the prospectus I wrote in preparation for my undergraduate senior economics essay. My coding samples are split into two folders. The folder "senior-essay-sample" contains a work-in-progress replication package of my senior essay research on the crowding-out effects of AI-driven data center development. You will find my data, R and Python code files, and corresponding output. The folder "ra-sample" contains a Stata code file I wrote to support Kaivan Munshi's ongoing research on organ transplant centers. Due to the confidentiality measures of patient data, I have omitted the data required to run the code file.

Thank you for considering my application.
